###Objectives

As engineers, we have come to realize how important 
scientists and engineers will be to make a world with 9 billion people go round. 

The Pilot Fish Project blends dozens of technologies and scientific themes, 
exploration and physical challenge.
It is a unique opportunity to pass our passion for engineering and challenge to younger generations. 
We owe our vocations to fight planes and space crafts of our childhood. 
Let\'s hope a more sober midget submarine will do the trick for our kids!

###Programme

- As much data as possible will be posted on the project website: 
progress news, educational material, real time data during the expedition.

- We will rely on education professionals at the National Aquarium of Plymouth 
and the Grand Aquarium of Saint-Malo to build multi-themes educational programs, 
targeting pupils before, during and after the expedition.

- In addition, we wish to set up exhibitions after the expedition 
featuring the submarine and the images and sounds from the Channel, 
possibly in these Aquariums, in the Saint-Malo marina, in our partners offices, in schools.
